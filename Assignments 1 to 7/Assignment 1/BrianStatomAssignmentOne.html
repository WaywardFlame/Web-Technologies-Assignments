		<h2><u>What is Morrowind?</u></h2>
		<p>
		The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind was an open world role playing game <br/>
		released by Bethesda Game Studios in 2002 for Windows and the Xbox. <br/>
		Following in the footsteps of the previous games in the series, <br/>
		Morrowind unleashes the player upon a massive open world, and lets them <br/>
		explore that world however they wish. The key difference from the previous <br/>
		games in the series is that Morrowind uses a handcrafted world, rather <br/>
		a procedurally generated one, and it managed to do so entirely with true 3D <br/>
		graphics, instead of the pseudo-3D graphics of the previous games. At the <br/>
		time, there nothing else quite like Morrowind's world. Yes, you had games <br/>
		that tried to simulate massive worlds, such as The Legend of Zelda games, <br/>
		but those typically relied on segmented worlds or massive amounts of empty <br/>
		terrain to be feasible on their target platforms, even the previous Elder <br/>
		Scrolls games had to use massive amounts of empty terrain. Morrowind did <br/>
		not have those limitations, which, in combination with the game's genuinely <br/>
		interesting setting and story, led to the game becoming a critical and <br/>
		commercial success.

		<h2><u>Why am I talking about Morrowind?</u></h2>
		<p>
		A couple of months ago now, I had played Morrowind for the first time <br/>
		after developing a interest in The Elder Scrolls series again, and <br/>
		because I was tired of waiting for The Elder Scrolls VI to come out. <br/>
		Before Morrowind, I had only dabbled in the fourth game, Oblivion, <br/>
		and I put a countless amount of time into the fifth game, Skyrim, as <br/>
		well as Bethesda's other RPG series, Fallout. Despite Morrowind's <br/>
		technical issues, and certain game design decisions that truly boggled <br/>
		my mind, I still found it to be a rather enjoyable experience. Every <br/>
		time that I thought I had had enough of the game, I found myself <br/>
		coming back again and again, seeking to see more of the world, and to learn <br/>
		more of a world that I knew very little about despite my time with Skyrim. <br/>
		And the game's story was actually good, which surprised me given Bethesda's <br/>
		recent reputation for not exactly making games with good writing. <br/>
		Simply put, the game was just good fantasy, and while I don't see myself <br/>
		returning to play the game again, it did make me remember why I loved <br/>
		Skyrim so much, and why I very much would like another Elder Scrolls <br/>
		after all this time.
