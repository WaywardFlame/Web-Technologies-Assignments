# Web-Technologies-Assignments
Assignments from my Web Technologies class that I took at UTSA during Spring 2025.

Also included are two documents that I was given while taking the class which show how to set up the AWS server that we needed. Perhaps you can take advantage of those documents if you wish to try to get the exact same results as I did.

For assignments 1 to 7, do note that there is no assignments 2 and 3, as I do not have copies of them. Also, some assignments include .tar.gz files, which, if I am remembering correctly, are essentially snapshots of my AWS server code at the time of assignment submission. They likely include code and files from other assignments as well.

The purpose of these assignments was teach various web development concepts, and make sure that we at least understood the basics of web development, as the professor didn't want to teach us any one specific tool or technology in the event that the job market decided it no longer desired that skill, or in the event that a student wished to pursue a different web dev skill. Basically, teach us the concepts so that we have the capacity to learn any web dev skill. As such, the assignments included involve a fair bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even PHP, but do not involve stuff such as React or Node.

Disclaimer for students: If you are a student, and you feel that my code can help, then feel free to use it, and be sure to credit me, but be aware that I hold no responsibility for whatever consequences may arise from your use of my code. Follow your professor's instructions, and don't blindly copy code from the internet. Be responsible, essentially.

Explanation of each assignment:

Assignment 1 --- Assignment 1 saw us having to learn HTML, as we figure out creating a document-like structure. I chose to base my writing on The Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind, as I had just finished playing the game a couple months before class started, and I really enjoyed my time with it.

Assignment 4 --- From what I remember, we were given a site, then were told that we had to fix that site in accordance with a provided set of desired changes. The end goal was really to make the site more presentable.

Assignment 5 --- Assignment 5 saw us learning some JavaScript, which involved us creating three different functions to display three different results.

Assignment 6 --- Assignment 6 saw us use JavaScript some more, but this time in conjuction with some HTML / CSS elements in order to display a variety of elements, alongside coloring those elements a variety of colors.

Assignment 7 --- Assignment 7 saw us attempting to create a sliding piece puzzle using an image of the UTSA logo. We had to divide the picture into different pieces, scramble them up, and allow for user input in order to attempt to solve the puzzle.

Assignment 8 --- Assignment 8 saw us learning some PHP, and essentially repeating assignment 5, only with PHP this time.

Assignment 9 --- From what I remember, we had to build somewhat on assignment 8, but this time we had to use PHP to create a variety of different functions instead that would perform various operations on generated data.

Assignment 10 --- Assignment 10, from what I remember, had us create a form for the user to provide input, then take that input and verify using PHP that it is in the appropriate format / structure. 

Assignment 11 --- Assignment 11 was split into two parts, and saw us taking a provided MySQL database, setting that up on the AWS server, and then using PHP to fetch data from the database in order to display requested data on the frontend. We didn't focus too much on the MySQL part of the assignment, as the professor felt it was outside the intended scope for us, although it was easier for me to understand this assignment because of a database systems that I had taken the previous semester.

Assignment 12 --- I don't quite remember what this was supposed to be exactly, but from the looks of it, it appears we had to do some data validation using JavaScript on the frontend, instead of relying on PHP.
