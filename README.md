# Web-Technologies-Assignments
Assignments from my Web Technologies class that I took at UTSA during Spring 2025.

Also included are two documents that I was given while taking the class which show how to set up the AWS server that we needed. Perhaps you can take advantage of those documents if you wish to try to get the exact same results as I did.

For assignments 1 to 7, do note that there is no assignments 2 and 3, as I do not have copies of them.

The purpose of these assignments was teach various web development concepts, and make sure that we at least understood the basics of web development, as the professor didn't want to teach us any one specific tool or technology in the event that the job market decided it no longer desired that skill, or in the event that a student wished to pursue a different web dev skill. Basically, teach us the concepts so that we have the capacity to learn any web dev skill. As such, the assignments included involve a fair bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and even PHP, but do not involve stuff such as React or Node.

Disclaimer for students: If you are a student, and you feel that my code can help, then feel free to use it, and be sure to credit me, but be aware that I hold no responsibility for whatever consequences may arise from your use of my code. Follow your professor's instructions, and don't blindly copy code from the internet. Be responsible, essentially.
